# BMI Calculator

A simple web application that calculates your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on the user's weight and height. This tool provides feedback on whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI.

## Features

- Calculates the **BMI** using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) \* height (m))
- Displays the BMI value along with a feedback message:
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9
- Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.9
- Obese: BMI ≥ 30
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
